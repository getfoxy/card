# Foxy card: a fork of cashu-javacard, for your review

From the Foxy wallet project (getfoxy), to the authors of `lnflash/cashu-javacard`.

We forked your applet at 0.4 (`c1f4580`, MIT) to make a card that pays a Foxy
wallet on an iPhone by a tap and a PIN. This note says what we changed and
why, what we have and have not tested, and where we would most value your
eyes. Section 3 includes things we found in your code as it stood at that
commit.

**State of it, plainly:** the applet has run on one real card (a J3R180) with
the Foxy app on one iPhone: installed, every command sent through a reader, and
a card set up, loaded, paid from and given its change back over NFC. It builds
to a CAP with the JavaCard 3.0.5 kit and passes its tests under jCardSim. The
wallet and the iPhone app have also been driven end to end against the applet's
own class in jCardSim, including with a few real sats at your own mint
(forge.flashapp.me). One card is not a batch; section 6 says what has not been
tested.

## 1. What we would like you to look at

1. **SPEND with no message from the reader** (3.2). Is rebuilding the secret
   on the card and hashing it there sound, and affordable on a J3R180? It is a
   string of 170 to 270 bytes and one SHA-256 for each piece, before the
   signature you already make.
2. **AUTH** (4). Is a signature over a tagged hash a safe way to prove the
   card holds its key, given that the same key signs spends?
3. **The daily limit, the clock and the owner's proof** (row 5 of section 3,
   and section 4). Our first answer to row 5 was a limit on what one PIN entry
   could spend, counted in RAM. A terminal that has the PIN walked round it, by
   sending the PIN again between spends or by setting the limit to nothing, and
   we removed it. The second was an allowance in permanent memory that every
   spend lowered and only a proof of a secret raised; it held against a
   terminal, but stopped a card whose owner's phone was not at hand, and we
   replaced it. The card now keeps a limit per day: the sats it will sign for in
   one day, counted against a day the card keeps itself, from a time it is told
   under an ECDSA signature (P-256) by a time key held in its record. Its clock
   only moves forward. The owner is a P-256 public key on the card, and a proof
   is an ECDSA signature over a label, a 16-byte nonce and the value being set;
   no secret is on the card or in the air. Each nonce is good for one try, so we
   believe an observed proof cannot be replayed against it. Is there a way round
   this that we have not seen? Is an ECDSA verify cheap enough on a J3R180 to do
   once for the time in every tap, and does the J3R180's verifier take the DER
   form and an uncompressed key? On the one card we have, it takes both, and a
   verify took about 45 ms. Note that **the time
   today is the receiving phone's own clock, signed by a key built into our app,
   so it is not secret**: a terminal built to cheat can sign any time it likes,
   and with the PIN take everything the PIN reaches. The limit bounds an honest
   terminal and the holder's own overspending, and nothing more, until a real
   signer replaces that key by provisioning. Our specification says so.
4. **The date and refund key on a piece** (5). Your notes called a refund
   path "the right shape" and named its flaw. We think the date on the slot
   answers it. Do you?
5. **Anything about real hardware** that jCardSim would not show us: memory
   for 64 slots of 82 bytes, torn writes, how long a tap takes with several
   pieces to sign, and how long the ECDSA verifies take (one for the time in
   every tap, one for each owner command).
6. Whether you would want any of this back upstream. The fork is not
   compatible with your wire, by intent, and has an AID of its own so neither
   applet can be taken for the other.

## 2. What it does

- A holder sets up a new card from their own phone, in one tap: the phone
  gives the card a PIN, then a record (which names the mint its ecash is at,
  and the time key), then an owner: a public key worked out from the holder's
  seed. No limit is set: a new card has none.
- The holder puts money on it: ordinary ecash, locked to the card's key
  (NUT-11), written into slots. The owner's phone does this with no PIN.
- To pay, the receiver's phone asks for the card's PIN, the card is tapped,
  the card signs for enough pieces to cover the amount, and the receiver
  swaps them at the mint. Only when the mint has answered does the receiver
  say paid.
- Change is made by the receiver, locked to the card's key, and written back
  onto the card in the same tap. If the card has left, it waits for that card.
- The holder can withdraw to their phone, change the PIN, unblock a blocked
  card, and set, change or remove the daily limit. A change of PIN, an
  unblock, a change of limit and adding funds with no PIN need a proof by the
  owner key, which only the holder's phone can make; they need no old PIN. A
  till can do none of them.
- A card is cash. It holds what is put on it. An honest terminal that has been
  handed the PIN takes at most one day's limit per visit. A terminal built to
  cheat is not bounded until the time the card is told comes from a real
  signer (see item 3 above).

## 3. What we found in 0.4, and what the fork does

We read 0.2 first and 0.4 again at `c1f4580`. If any of this has changed
since, the fault is in our reading.

| # | In 0.4 as we read it | The fork |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | A blocked PIN used to open every gated command. **Fixed in 0.4** (`requirePinIfSet` treats blocked as set). | Kept, with a test that walks every gated command through every PIN state. |
| 2 | `SPEND_PROOF` signs 32 bytes the reader supplies. The card does not check that they are the hash of the slot's own secret, so a reader chooses what is signed, and the slot marked spent need not be the piece that was spent. | `SPEND` takes a slot number and nothing else. The card builds that slot's secret from its own key and the slot's fields, hashes it, signs in RAM, marks the slot spent, and only then sends the signature (signing after the burn lost the piece whenever the card was pulled away mid-signature). |
| 3 | `SIGN_ARBITRARY` signs any 32 bytes with the card's key and burns no slot. With the PIN, a reader can sign for every piece on the card and leave every slot reading unspent. | Removed. Proving the card is the card has its own command (section 4). |
| 4 | A card with no PIN accepts loads and spends from any reader in range. | Nothing is loaded onto a card until a PIN is set and verified, nor onto a card with no owner. A card with no owner is open while it is empty: any reader can give it a PIN, a record and an owner, but it holds nothing and cannot be loaded. A card with an owner is its owner's, empty or not, so a terminal that has the PIN and empties a card cannot then claim it. Ours are set up before they leave our hands. |
| 5 | A reader with the PIN can spend every slot in one tap. By design, but the holder has typed their PIN into somebody else's terminal. | Our first answer was a limit on what one PIN entry may spend. **It did not hold:** a terminal that has the PIN presents it again between spends, which reset the count, or sets the limit to nothing, because the PIN alone could. It is removed. Our second, an allowance that only went down and only an owner's proof raised, held against a terminal but stopped a card whose owner's phone was not at hand. The card now keeps a limit per day, with a day of its own: a clock (`now`) that only moves forward, set under an ECDSA signature by a time key in the card's record. Every spend adds the whole piece signed to what has been signed today, in the same transaction that burns the slot; a piece that would take today past the limit is refused before anything is signed; only the owner's proof sets or removes the limit. **The time today is the receiving phone's own clock, signed by a key built into our app, so it is not secret.** A terminal built to cheat can sign any time and, with the PIN, take everything the PIN reaches; the limit then bounds only honest terminals and the holder's own spending. A real signer replaces the key by provisioning a different time key, not by a new applet. A card is cash. |
| 6 | The card does not say which mint its pieces are at (an open question in your notes). | A card record names the mint. |
| 7 | No DLEQ on the card, so a piece cannot be checked without the mint. | Unchanged. Our receiver is always online and always swaps before saying paid. |
| 8 | The deployment guide installs with the card's factory GlobalPlatform keys and does not change them afterwards. A card left on them can have the applet deleted, and the money with it, by anyone with a reader. | Not the applet's to fix. Our provisioning steps will change them. |
| 9 | In flash-pos, when we read it: an exact payment was shown as paid when the swap had failed, and a proof the mint reported as spent was booked as settled, whoever spent it. | Not our code, and you may have fixed it. Our rule is that paid means the mint has given this phone its own pieces. |
| 10 | `CHANGE_PIN` needs a verified session and the old PIN, both of which a reader handed the PIN has. It can set a PIN the holder does not know, and the holder's wrong tries then block the card for good (your threat 14, by another road). | The owner's proof replaces both: the proof and the new PIN only, no old PIN and no session. A wrong proof costs no tries. The same command unblocks a blocked card. |
| 11 | `LOCK_CARD` needs the PIN only if one is set: any reader can lock a card with no PIN for good, and a reader that has the PIN can lock a funded card (it keeps paying, and can never be loaded, cleared or changed). | A PIN set and verified, and the owner's proof. A card with no owner cannot be locked. |

Number 2 and number 3 are the ones that matter most. Together they mean the
SPENT flag on the card protects nothing: the signature is what spends, and
the card will sign without burning the right slot, or any slot.

## 4. What changed on the wire

Class `B0` as yours. AID: package `F0 46 4F 58 59 43 41 52 44`, applet the same with `01`.

| Command | Yours | Ours |
|---|---|---|
| `01` GET_INFO | 8 bytes | 29: adds format, tries left, locked, has-record, the daily limit, has-owner, then the day (`now`, window start, spent today) |
| `13` GET_PROOF | 78-byte slot | 82: adds a 4-byte date |
| `15` AUTH | none | reader sends 16 random bytes; card answers 16 of its own and a BIP-340 signature. No PIN |
| `16` GET_CARD | none | the card record, with the daily limit and the time key |
| `20` SPEND | slot + 32-byte message | slot only. With a limit set, refused (`6A8F`) for a piece that would take today past it, and (`6A92`) on a card never told the time; otherwise adds the piece's whole amount to what is spent today in the transaction that marks the slot spent |
| `21` SIGN_ARBITRARY | signs anything | removed (`6D00`) |
| `30` LOAD_PROOF | 77 bytes | 81, with the date; needs an owner on the card, a card record, a time, and a PIN set and verified or the owner's `ALLOW_LOAD` for the tap. Never touches the limit |
| `31` CLEAR_SPENT | the PIN if one is set | the PIN if one is set, or the owner's `ALLOW_LOAD` for the tap |
| `32` SET_CARD | none | writes the record (unit, refund key, time key, mint); a PIN on a card with no owner, the owner's proof on a card with one; refused while the card holds unspent pieces. Never touches the limit |
| `33` SET_LIMIT, PIN form | none | the daily limit (4 bytes, big-endian; 0 is none), by the PIN, on a card with no owner and nothing unspent only. (`33` was once a limit on one PIN entry, removed; this is not that) |
| `34` SET_LIMIT, owner's form | none | proof length, proof, then the limit. The owner's proof, no PIN, any funds |
| `35` SET_TIME | none | time (4), signature length, signature (ECDSA by the time key over `"FoxyCard/time" ‖ time`). No PIN, no owner. Moves the card's clock forward only; answers its `now` |
| `41` SET_PIN | the PIN, once (`6985` if one exists) | sets or replaces the PIN, and unblocks, on a card with no owner and nothing unspent only. A card with an owner refuses it (`6A91`) |
| `42` CHANGE_PIN | old PIN length, old PIN, new PIN | proof length, proof, new PIN. The owner's proof; no old PIN, no session, any PIN state, any funds. Resets the tries |
| `43` SET_OWNER | none | the owner's public key, 65 bytes uncompressed. On a card with no owner while it is empty, with no proof; on a card with an owner, only with the old owner's proof and only while it is empty (`6A8D` otherwise, `6A91` without a good proof) |
| `44` GET_NONCE | none | no data; answers a fresh 16 bytes held in RAM. No PIN; `6A90` on a card with no owner |
| `45` ALLOW_LOAD | none | the owner's proof (label `FoxyCard/load`). For the rest of that tap, `LOAD_PROOF` and `CLEAR_SPENT` need no PIN. Not `SPEND` |
| `50` LOCK_CARD | the PIN if one is set; `P2 = DE` | a PIN set and verified, `P2 = DE`, and the owner's proof as data |

New status words: `6A8F` over the day's limit (was "over the limit"), `6A90`
no owner, `6A91` the owner's proof is missing or wrong, or the command is not
open to a card with an owner, `6A92` the card has never been told the time and
this needs it, `6A93` a `SET_TIME` whose signature is not the time key's,
`6A94` a `LOAD_PROOF` of a piece whose nonce is already in a slot, spent or not.

64 slots of 82 bytes (yours: 32 of 78). The card record is unit, the daily
limit, a 33-byte refund key, a 65-byte time key, the clock and the day, and the
mint's address (up to 80 bytes). Apart from it the card keeps a 65-byte owner
public key, which nothing reads out. The applet's version is 1.1 (`SELECT`
answers `01 01`) and the format byte is 3.

**The owner and its proof.** The holder's phone works the owner's private key out
for each card as HMAC-SHA256 with the 64-byte BIP-39 seed as the key, over
`"FoxyCard/owner" ‖ 0x00 ‖` the card's 33-byte compressed key, taken mod the
order of P-256, in its native side only; the page never holds it. It gives the
card the public half with `SET_OWNER`, last in the set-up tap. A proof is an
ECDSA signature (P-256, SHA-256, DER) by that key over `label ‖ nonce (16) ‖
value`, with the nonce from `GET_NONCE`, verified on the card. It is one try for
each nonce, gone with the tap, and a wrong proof costs no PIN tries and does not
end the PIN session.

| Command | Label (ASCII) | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `CHANGE_PIN` | `FoxyCard/change-pin` | the new PIN's bytes |
| `SET_LIMIT` (`34`) | `FoxyCard/set-limit` | the new limit, 4 bytes, big-endian |
| `SET_OWNER` (on a card with an owner) | `FoxyCard/set-owner` | the new owner key, 65 bytes |
| `SET_CARD` (on a card with an owner) | `FoxyCard/set-card` | the data sent |
| `ALLOW_LOAD` | `FoxyCard/load` | nothing |
| `LOCK_CARD` | `FoxyCard/lock` | nothing |

A proof for one command or value is no proof for another, and an old or used
one fails (`6A91`). Nothing of the owner crosses the air: no secret is on the
card or sent to it, and the page never holds one. A card is set up in one tap:
`SET_PIN`, `VERIFY_PIN`, `SET_CARD`, then `SET_OWNER` last, so that no step
needs a proof and a set-up cut off anywhere is finished by the next. A card
with no owner cannot be loaded, and is open while it is empty.

**The clock.** `SET_TIME` takes a time under a signature by the time key in the
card's record. The card keeps `now`, the latest time it has been told, which only
moves forward; setting the limit begins a window at `now`, and a `SPEND` that
finds `now` a day (86,400 seconds) or more past the window's start begins a new
one. Nothing else begins a window. `LOAD_PROOF` is refused on a card that has
never been told the time, so the earliest `now` a funded card can hold is its own
loading. The one way `now` goes back is a `SET_CARD` that writes a different time
key, on a card with nothing unspent: the way out of a wrongly signed time.

If the J3R180 turns out to have no usable ECDSA verifier, we have a documented
fallback for the owner's proof, built on a hash of a secret; the time signature
has no fallback and must verify.

**What SPEND signs.** SHA-256 of the secret, where the secret is the exact
text cashu-ts writes for a P2PK piece, built on the card:

    ["P2PK",{"nonce":"<64 hex>","data":"<card key, 66 hex>","tags":[]}]

and for a piece with a date:

    ["P2PK",{"nonce":"…","data":"…","tags":[["locktime","<decimal>"],["refund","<66 hex>"]]}]

So loading a card is an ordinary locked send from any NUT-11 wallet, and
nothing is made specially for it. This is not your secret text.

**What AUTH signs.** SHA-256 of `T ‖ T ‖ reader16 ‖ card16 ‖ cardkey33`, with
`T = SHA-256("FoxyCard/auth")`. The message is 129 bytes behind a tag; a
secret is text beginning `["P2PK"`. We believe no AUTH message can be a
secret's preimage, and would like that checked.

## 5. A lost or blocked card

The applet and the wallet can make a card recoverable: each piece carries a
locktime a year ahead and a refund key the loading phone derives from its
seed, and after that date the phone can take back what the card has not
spent. The card checks no date against a clock (the `now` it keeps for the
daily limit is only the latest time it has been told, and is not used for
dates), which is the flaw your notes name: a mint may stop honouring the card's
own signature once the date passes. So the date is on the slot where a reader
sees it, and a receiving wallet refuses a piece within a week of its date
before asking the card to sign.

**In the app this is switched off for now.** Cards are set up as cash, as
yours are: lose the card and the money is gone. A forgotten PIN or a blocked
card is put right from the owner's phone, which sets a new PIN with no old one.
The app says a card is cash when it is set up.

## 6. What has been tested, and what has not

Tested:
- The applet under jCardSim, including every gated command in every PIN state,
  the secret the card signs against the text a wallet builds, your write-order
  tests adapted to the new slot, the daily limit and the clock (a reader that
  has the PIN and sends it between spends takes one piece of four, and takes a
  second only after a signed time a day later; exactly the limit goes and one sat
  more does not, with nothing burned; a window turns at 86,400 seconds and not
  at 86,399; a signature by another key is `6A93`; an older time changes
  nothing), and the owner (each command refused with the PIN alone, with another
  command's label, another value, another nonce, another key's signature, or a
  used proof, and accepted with the right proof and no PIN; a wrong proof costs
  no PIN tries; a card with an owner refuses the PIN's `SET_PIN`, `SET_OWNER`,
  `SET_CARD` and `SET_LIMIT` even when empty; a card with no owner cannot be
  loaded). A test reads the source to check that the slot and what is spent
  today change in one transaction, with the signing after it.
- The wallet's flows against a JavaScript model of the card, and the model
  against a recorded conversation with the applet.
- The same flows against the applet itself over a socket: set-up, loading,
  paying with change, a card pulled away at each point of a payment in turn,
  PIN change, three wrong PINs, emptying.
- The iPhone app in the simulator against the applet in jCardSim, at a test
  mint and at forge.flashapp.me: set up, add funds, pay an invoice by card
  with change written back, withdraw.

Run on one real card, and not beyond it: install, every command, NFC with an
iPhone, and timing (an ECDSA verify about 45 ms, a spend about three quarters
of a second a piece, the card's own Schnorr in software, and a read tap about a
second and a quarter over contact).

Not tested:
- More than one card, and a batch. No torn write on silicon, and no write
  endurance for the extra write on every spend.
- The wallet and the iPhone app against the daily limit, the clock and the owner
  key on a real card, beyond a set-up and a payment: the applet's side of them
  was walked command by command through a reader.
- Any mint's behaviour once a locktime has passed.

## 7. Three things that may be useful to you

- **Long keyset ids.** A slot has 8 bytes for the keyset. Mints we tried now
  name keysets by 33 bytes (ids beginning `01`). We store NUT-02's short form,
  the first 8 bytes, and the wallet expands it against the mint's keyset list,
  refusing if two keysets share it. Your slot has the same 8 bytes. Your own
  mint still uses the 8-byte form, so you may not have met this yet.
- **A phone should not carry whatever a page hands it.** Our iPhone code reads
  each command before sending it and carries only the SELECT of our own AID
  and our applet's instructions. The AID is also the only one in the app's
  Info.plist, so iOS never hands the app another card.
- **jCardSim gives every card the same key**, as your source notes. Two
  simulated cards are one card to a wallet that files things by card key. Our
  test server reseeds the key pair by reflection.

## 8. What it does not protect against

A card is cash. It holds what is put on it. The daily limit bounds an honest
terminal that has been handed the PIN to one day's limit per visit. It does not
bound a terminal built to cheat, today.

- **A terminal built to cheat, today.** The time the card is told is the
  receiving phone's own clock, signed by a key that is built into our app and is
  not secret. A terminal can sign its own time, day after day in one tap, and
  take everything the PIN reaches. The limit bounds honest terminals and the
  holder's own overspending, and that is all it is said to do, until a real
  signer replaces that key.
- A terminal that has been handed the PIN takes one day's limit per visit, and up
  to two across a window's boundary, **once the time is real**. The limit does
  not check a payment, and change loaded onto the card does not give the day
  anything back, so a till should pick pieces as close to the price as it can.
- The same terminal can write onto the card pieces the mint will refuse, made up
  with a nonce no mint ever signed. They take nothing from anyone, since our
  receiver asks the mint, but a later payment that picks one burns slots and
  spends a day's limit on nothing. A fake piece looks unspent to a state check, so
  this waits on DLEQ on the card.
- It cannot write a copy of a real piece: the card signs a piece's secret, which
  its nonce makes, and takes the amount on the terminal's word, so a copy stating
  an amount of 1 would have been spent for 1 and signed for the real piece.
  `LOAD_PROOF` refuses a nonce that is in any slot, spent or not (`6A94`). The card
  does not remember a nonce once `CLEAR_SPENT` has freed its slot.
- A holder whose owner has lost their words can never change the PIN or the
  limit, or unblock a blocked card. Whoever has the owner's words and the card in
  hand has everything on it.
- Whoever holds the time key's private half (today, anybody) can move clocks
  forward. A wrongly signed far-future time freezes a card's day until its owner
  writes it a new time key while it is empty.
- Any reader in range can send three wrong PINs and block the card. Its owner's
  phone unblocks it.
- A pretend card can collect a PIN typed for it. A receiver loses nothing to
  one, because it goes to the mint before saying paid.
- The PIN crosses a few centimetres of air in the clear. Nothing of the owner
  does.
- A card with no owner can be claimed by any reader. It holds nothing and cannot
  be loaded.
- A cash card that is lost is lost money.

## 9. Where it is

Two public repositories.

- `getfoxy/card` (https://github.com/getfoxy/card): the applet. Start with
  `FORK.md`, then `docs/FOXY-CARD-SPEC.md`, and `docs/FOXY-CARD-DAILY-LIMIT.md`
  for the daily limit, the clock and the owner key in full. `spec/vectors/` has
  the secrets and a full conversation with the card. Your own `spec/`, `README`
  and `tools/cardctl` are still in the tree and still describe your wire.
- `getfoxy/iOS` (https://github.com/getfoxy/iOS): the wallet. The card code is
  `build/wallet/08a-flashcard.js` and `21a-flashcard.js`, the iPhone side
  `Foxy/Flashcard/`, the tests `tests/flashcard-*.js`, and what the app does
  with a card is `docs/CARD.md`.
